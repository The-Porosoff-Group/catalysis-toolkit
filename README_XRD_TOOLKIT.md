# XRD Fitting Toolkit

Standalone XRD fitting interface from the Catalysis Data Toolkit.

This version opens directly into the XRD workflow and hides unfinished modules. It is intended as a local desktop web app for importing CIFs, previewing XRD tick patterns, and running GSAS-II refinements from a browser-based GUI.

## Quick Start

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Add your Materials Project API key:

   ```bat
   copy config.yaml.example config.yaml
   notepad config.yaml
   ```

3. Start the XRD-only GUI:

   ```bat
   xrd_toolkit\run_xrd_toolkit.bat
   ```

4. Open, if the browser does not open automatically:

   ```text
   http://localhost:5000/xrd
   ```

The first launch creates a local Python environment and installs dependencies. GSAS-II installation can take several minutes.

## Main Features

- XRD file upload with live preview
- Materials Project phase search
- Manual CIF upload
- CIF caching and validation
- Correct preview tick generation from imported phases
- GSAS-II refinement backend
- `.instprm` instrument parameter support
- Built-in WC/W2C Synergy-S production preset
- Saved user presets
- Per-phase controls for:
  - crystallite size
  - microstrain
  - March-Dollase preferred orientation
  - diagnostic uniform-cell handling for W2C-like phases
- Fit warnings and baseline comparison
- Outputs for phase fraction, uncertainty notes, FWHM reference peak, crystallite size, preferred-orientation value, and cell-change percentages

## Recommended Workflow

1. Upload the measured XRD pattern.
2. Set wavelength and 2-theta range.
3. Search Materials Project or upload CIFs for the expected phases.
4. Run a constrained baseline fit.
5. Mark/save the baseline in the GUI.
6. Add one refinement freedom at a time.
7. Compare the new fit against the baseline.
8. Save a validated preset for related samples.

Do not keep extra fit freedoms just because Rwp improves. Preferred orientation, Uiso, size, microstrain, and atom-position refinement can all improve the statistic while also changing phase fractions or absorbing model error.

## WC/W2C Preset

The built-in WC/W2C Synergy-S preset uses a fixed WC [001] March-Dollase preferred-orientation value near `0.905`. That value came from a comparison workflow and is meant as a production prior for this specific recipe. It is not a universal WC constant.

## Notes on GitHub Pages

This toolkit cannot run directly as a static GitHub Pages site because it depends on Python, Flask, GSAS-II, local file uploads, and local refinement outputs. GitHub can host the source code and documentation, but users run the app locally with the launcher.
